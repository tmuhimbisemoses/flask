hello.py:  Basic Hello World page generated using Flask

headlines.py : A simple attempt at creating an RSS feed reader using BBC as a news source. I faced difficulties that am yet to overcome in                creating multiple headlines. At the moment, all I have managed to create is a single headline article. The challenge in                    creating multiple articles arises from the faliure of the Jinja (template engine) python dependency to install even after                  using pip install. As such, i neglected the use of templates and relied on hard coded html pages.
